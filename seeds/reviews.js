Or maybe the narrator says it to the character: the story is told entirely in the second person, a decision that is strikingly odd at the start, then quickly becomes part of the alienating texture of this intoxicatingly strange novel. This “you” compels the reader into a very disquieting question from the first page – who am I? Am I this you? – which, as it happens, is the same question the main character orbits throughout. Who is she? Is she you? The limits of self wear away and identity bleeds out, and no one is quite secure in their skin.`, review_isbn: 9780062110916 },

The first edition has now sold out (though may still be available from some book shops, such as Unity Books) but a second, un-numbered edition is now available. The books are bound with hemp and flax-linen thread, and features a fly-leaf insert of hand-made harakeke (New Zealand flax) paper made by Pakohe Papers in Whanganui.`, review_isbn: 9780994134509 },
        { id: 3, reviewer_name: `mxbialostocki`, review_head: 'Ever Been Raised in a Seminary?', review_body: `When Patricia was 19, in 2002, she met her future husband Jason on an internet poetry forum. She was living at home – her father, a “loose, lazy pile of carnality”, was happy to spend money on himself but unable to fund his children through college. After months of exchanged messages, Jason drove from Colorado to Missouri finally to meet her. He half-assumed she would be “fifty years old and Latina”; Lockwood in turn was worried that poets “were the sort of people who said ‘lo’ in conversation”. Her parents were naturally wary of the stranger, and Jason was greeted by her father with the screech: “Gimme your license. I got cop friends.” Though an immediate marriage proposal took place – “in the parking lot of … the most matrimonial of all grocery stores” – her mother and father were convinced Tricia was about to drive off with a murderer. It was her sister Mary who pointed out that “We are the ones who are not normal”.`, review_isbn: 9780141984599 },

Throughout the series the class and conditions that made him are viciously torn open for the world to see. One is left wondering if a world like that can create anything other than despicable characters.`, review_isbn: 9780312429966 },
        { id: 5, reviewer_name: `mxbialostocki`, review_head: `"I was popular in certain circles..."`, review_body: `This reissue of Grace Paley's classic collection—a finalist for the National Book Award—demonstrates her rich use of language as well as her extraordinary insight into and compassion for her characters, moving from the hilarious to the tragic and back again. Whether writing about the love (and conflict) between parents and children or between husband and wife, or about the struggles of aging single mothers or disheartened political organizers to make sense of the world, she brings the same unerring ear for the rhythm of life as it is actually lived. The Collected Stories is a 1994 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.`, review_isbn: 9780374530280 },

Well, that's a bit much."`, review_body: `I want you to understand something straight off the bat: Clarice Lispector wrote her first novel, Near to the Wild Heart (Perto do coração selvagem), in 1942 and published it at only 23 years old. She struggled with her writing process, one stating: “When I reread what I’ve written, I feel like I’m swallowing my own vomit.” But what came out of her struggle went on to become a necessary, heart-breaking and riling classic in the vein of Kate Chopin's The Awakening, or Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House. I am convinced that this is the Brazilian novelist that you never knew you needed.`, review_isbn: 9780811220026 },

Three of the stories are obliquely connected and feature young women on the edge. In the first of these, a new mother contemplates her new baby; in the second, a girl finds herself in rehab; and in the final story, the main character goes to jail. Other characters include a New Zealand serviceman returned from active duty in Dili, the employees of a $2 shop, and a vegan couple at a Samoan resort.', review_isbn: 9780864736253 },
        { id: 8, reviewer_name: `Aimee Bender`, review_head: `Ever fallen in love with a merman?`, review_body: `The Pisces is many things: a jaunt in a fabulous voice, a culture critique of Los Angeles, an explicit tour of all kinds of sex (both really good and really bad), but possibly most of all, it is a persuasive excavation into what might drive Lucy’s compulsion for a certain kind of connection ... Broder’s voice has a funny, frank Amy Schumer feel to it, injected with moments of a Lydia Davis-type of abstraction that can turn the existence of a woman walking by in skimpy silk shorts into a meditation on meaninglessness. These are often the strongest moves of the novel’s voice: from the minor keen observation into the resonant theoretical. At other times, though, we are so centered in Lucy’s head that the outside world drifts too far away ... By the end, the character and Broder acknowledge something else is going on. There is plenty of lively sex and humor here for readers to relish, but trade Eros for Thanatos for the book’s center — and depth.`, review_isbn: 9781524761554 },

A secret place, cryptic like a snuff film, but on paper, made of language. And yet, the full novel version of Last Days is all about truncation—it follows the experience of an ex-detective named Kline, who is abducted into a cult-like society that believes amputation brings people closer to God. Once taken, he is forced to help them investigate who murdered their leader. The clinical tone with which Evenson is able to traverse such situations, and the strange stark architecture of their world, makes even the most insidious or repulsive situations seem plausible, mathematical, nearby. Nothing is real, so everything is real.`, review_isbn: 9781566894166 },

She quit book reviewing for the New York Times because it was "inteferring with her reading". What an absolute queen.`, review_isbn: 9780143039532 },

What follows is an eerie treatise on society's tendency to take the easiest option available, with the eventual realisation that we are rarely willing to understand let alone fulfil the contracts we enter into. Because people are short sighted and rather stupid.`, review_isbn: 9781590176689 },

But the new preacher is not all they seem. So dangerously ruffling that the gay author was accused of being homophobic upon submitting the first draft because of the depth of psychological analysis. If I'm being honest I doubt you can even handle this book.`, review_isbn: 9781780748498 },

Lilith is born a slave in 1800s Jamaica, and is shaped by the violence and brutality she witnesses from birth. As a revolt is planned around her, she struggles to accept the realities of her prison. Written in a beautiful and difficult dialect, this novel begs the attention of a reader, and you would do well to offer it.`, review_isbn: 9781594484360 },

As a collection, its dedication to Pardington’s photographic work is pure and resolute. But while the visual documentation of her photography is well-presented and a testament to the value of print design itself, the depth of this collection isn’t only in her oeuvre, but in the strong analyses of her work and her relevance to our national culture. The front is weighted with an accumulation of essays about her work, some newly commissioned, with archive texts and an interview with the artist. Through the textual contributions, the only consistency is a profound respect for the artist and her work. The work itself is a biography of Pardington, and this is a beautiful thing.`, review_isbn: 9781776560547 },

In society, they are everywhere.`, review_body: `Hughes' debut novel drops with a poet's lyricism and acidic wit so sharp you'll put fingernail marks in the cover. The young Gael's pursuit of her own definition against the world offers ambition and reactive deviousness to rival that of a Shakespearean court. Complexity of character, complication of family, no expectation left undefiled. The Orchid & the Wasp was hands-down my favourite novel of 2018`, review_isbn: 9781524761103 },

Keep your wrists free so you can draw them against your brow, and prepare for small fits of romantic frustration. Too many of these poems are only appearing in English for the first time, which is just as well, as we may not have been able to handle them until now.`, review_isbn: 9780141987880 },

Mid-way through reading The Chronology of Water I felt like Yuknavitch was repeatedly stabbing me in the chest. Brutal honesty, a life of finding out how to feel, each person she talks about cast in front of you as you read, as large as they must have been in her life. Some call this a story of survival, but the story transcends any of the simplistic words that could describe it. I don't think that at any point Yuknavitch was intending to be funny, but you laugh throughout the book because it's your best option. I can't imagine only reading this once, I know I will come back to it again and again - like Lisa Crystal Carver's Drugs Are Nice, or Leslie Jamison's The Recovering, the broken mechanics of finding yourself against the years are broken apart and expressed raw to you. Do it over a single day.`, review_isbn: 9781786894373 },

Starkly written, heartfelt and to the point, no frills, just the story that they shared. Smith wrote this biography to fulfill a promise to her oldest friend when Mapplethorpe passed away in 1989. Her poet's voice comes through, but doesn't tint the story she tells in any way. Their relationship was colorful enough by itself, and  her memories bounce too well off the documentation that Mapplethorpe conducted himself through his earliest photography. See if you can find a couple of monographs in the library before you start reading, or pick up the recently published illustrated edition so that as Smith tells you about an afternoon they spent taking photographs in a small apartment in New York, you can flip through to see exactly the photographs mentioned, and the very look in her eye that she describes.`, review_isbn: 9780747568766 }
