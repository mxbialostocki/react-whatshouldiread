## what is this?
whatshouldiread is a web app that upon user interaction returns a really good book recommendation from a heavily curated list of short reviews. If the returned book is not your jam, you can return another random choice, or dictate whether your recommendations are going to be in the arenas of fiction, poetry, or short fiction.
Subsequent features: 
1. View a cloud of all reviews by cover, based on kindOfBook, with no other information until clicked.
